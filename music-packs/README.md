# music-packs guide
## Overview
This folder can have music packs added to it. You will be able to select which pack you want to use on the first page of the randomizer.

## Basic Use
Place a folder inside of 'music-packs.' This folder will be named whatever you want, but should describe the pack. As an example, it could be called, 'Example Music Pack.'
Inside that folder will be a bunch of music files. These are files in the brstm format. The rando will apply them if you do one of the two following layouts:
  1. Have a folder full music files with the exact name of the music file you want to replace in, 'modified-extract/DATA/files/Sound/wzs'
  2. Have a bunch of music files named whatever with the .brstm extention. Include a file called, 'replacements.txt,' which explains what music files will be replaced to what song.

## NOTE
As of this beta build, the second option has not yet been implemented.
